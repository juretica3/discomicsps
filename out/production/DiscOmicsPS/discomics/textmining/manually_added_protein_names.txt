FORMAT: first entry in line is approved HGNC gene name, all next entries in the line are terms to be added to the nomenclature of the gene separated by the “|”. Add the (name) or (symbol) tags after the entry to distinguish between added symbols and names; (name) is the default tag. Note that greek symbols will be added programmatically, and that hyphens and spaces are equivalentMAPK9|JNK1/2(symbol)SPP1|OPN(symbol)|osteopontin(name)VCAN|CSPG2(symbol)MAPK10|JNK1/2/3(symbol)|JNK2/3(symbol)KNG1|bradykinin(name)|BDK(symbol)TUBA1A|brain specific tubulin(name)TUBA4A|tubulin alpha(name)|alpha tubulin(name)ACTB|cytoplasmic actin(name)|actin cytoplasmic(name)ACTA1|actin alpha 1(name)|actin alpha1(name)|alpha1 actin(name)|alpha 1 actin(name)|skeletal muscle actin(name)|actin skeletal muscle(name)ACTA2|smooth muscle actin(name)|actin smooth muscle(name)|SMA(symbol)|alpha SMA(name)|alphaSMA(name)|actin alpha 2(name)|alpha 2 actin(name)|actin alpha2(name)|alpha2 actin(name)ACTC1|actin cardiac muscle(name)|cardiac muscle actin(name)ACTG2|actin gamma 2(name)|actin gamma2(name)|gamma2 actin(name)|gamma 2 actin(name)|enteric smooth muscle actin(name)
